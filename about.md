We are a small (as of now) group of programmers/software developers based around Chandigarh who want to build/have a healthy tech culture in Tricity. We in this group hope to create a culture which encourage experimentation and learning exciting things. Or at the very least, create a bubble around us that does.

Like Paul Graham said in his [brilliant article](http://paulgraham.com/cities.html), every city sends a message. The message Chandigarh sends is not very encouraging for our tech enthusiasts. The meager presence of software companies in Chandigarh is not doing a lot of good for the city. A lot of these seem to be sweat shops, havens of exploitation of employees. There is a very toxic culture of "education" that is already sunk deep in our whole region. A lot of talent gets wasted at the hands of phony colleges and training institutes, most of the rest flee to places which show some promise for tech-heads.

We love this city. We want to change this. The whole lack of a tech culture is a curse, and an opportunity as well. We have a clean slate. We can try to create a healthy culture which encourage innovation and initiative, learning and teaching technology as a form of art instead of creating more 9-to-5 code monkeys.

If you are a programmer, or want to be, or are just looking to check out if programming is for you, meet us at one of our meetups. We have a group on meetup.com where we announce our meetups: <http://www.meetup.com/Chandigarh-Programmers-Club>

Or you can have a chat with us on our slack channel: <http://pcchd.slack.com>
