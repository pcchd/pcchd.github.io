It was a great meetup, full of meaningful discussion. The topic was "Everything you need to know about modern Javascript Apps". An obviously cheesy heading with a strong implication that it was for beginners. I believe it is
a given that in a group which targets such a wide audience ("Programmers' Club"), it is hard to dig
deeper into any particular topic.

The turnout for this meetup was less than the previous meet, but better than average. This time none of us did
any "marketting" (aggressive sharing on social media), so I suppose this is was the result. Perhaps we should
deploy some marketing bots or something.

We had couple of students from PU. We got to learn from them that their colleges actually do organize tech events, some of which are /sometimes/ open to rest of the city, which most of us never get to hear of. This gave me
some confidence about the project I started (which is stalled as of now) to have an tech event-aggregator app.

## Follow-up-talks for monthly meetups

There was also the dialogue to do follow-ups on the generic topics we cover in monthly meetups. Vidur was open
to host these events as well, which is really nice of him (PS [Workcave](http://www.workcave.in/) is awesome guys, please do consider it if you ever need a co-working space in Chandigarh). Since this time's topic was
Javascript, we have decide to have a Javascript Workshop coming fortnight. It'll be a React.js (next.js) workshop
lead by either Charanjit or Gaurav.

## Meetup day moved to Sundays

Saturday is a working day for Workcave, and since we don't exactly have any other place to host meetups, we have
decided to organize meetups on Sundays instead.
