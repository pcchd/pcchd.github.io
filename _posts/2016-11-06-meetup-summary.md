title: Summary for PCC meetup on Sunday 11th November, 2016
---

Meetup went better than I expected. We had a nice discussion on various topics. Only 4 of us attended this meetup, me (Charanjit), Bunny, Abhijeet and Paras.

## (Over)Planning

Kinda-sorta agenda of this meetup was to discuss the sorry state of technology in tricity, and come up with/discuss ideas about how to take this group further to change that. After discussing several ideas, we decided that this group is going to focus on self-learning.

-   We as members of this group will decide a topic that we all want to learn
-   choose a structure to follow to achieve that
-   meet weekly/bi-weekly/monthly to reflect/discuss what each of us learned; and at least one member will give a small presentation on what was supposed to be covered for that time frame

These meetings/meetups are for discussing what we learned in past week, get our problems resolved, fill up what we missed etc. But instead of keeping the purpose of meetup so vague, we decided that it'll be better if one of us (i.e members of the group) take responsibility to give a small presentation on what they learned in past week. This person of course has the extra responsibility since now (s)he's acting as kinda-sorta mentor.

### Topic to tackle next: Algorithms and Data Structures

Since we all have different tech-backgrounds, we wanted to choose something that we are all new to. But since this is the first time, instead of picking something more new (to us) (Machine Learning, IOT, Functional Programming were contenders), we decided to brush up basics of CS theory (coincidently, it's quite new to me ðŸ˜…) and go for Algorithms and Data Structures. Plan is that we'll pick up a course online, follow it through and then decide how to proceed next.

## Github Organization

We have created a Github organization for the group where we can keep code that we write in/for our meetups. Only repository for now is for storing/sharing progress of our Algorithms and DS run discussed above: <https://github.com/programmers-club-chandigarh/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures>

## Slack Channel

Whatsapp group isn't very good for long/proper discussions, especially when we want to paste code snippets and stuff. So we have created a slack group <https://pcchd.slack.com/>

## What's up for next meetup

Since all of us are local to Mohali, we decided to meet weekly. Winning thought was that since we don't have active members from farther locations, we can use it to our advantage. Plan is to meet in the evening (after office hours) once in a week, and do above mentioned meetups. **The next meetup was decided to be on Tuesday 15th, 2016 at Bunny's place**.

Abhijeet is going to be presenting in first meetup, on topics he'll choose. We are yet to decide which Algorithms course we are going to follow.
