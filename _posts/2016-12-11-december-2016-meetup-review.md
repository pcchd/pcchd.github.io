We were expecting good turn around this time, since the date was decided after discussing all regular members' availability (join the [slack channel](https://pcchd-slack.herokuapp.com/) to participate in these discussions), but we had a total attendance of 4, including the host and the speaker. Which is sad.

Despite the low attendance, I'd still consider the meetup to be successful though. We had very good technical and non-technical discussions. I learned many things from Vidur, Paramvir and of course, Bineet.

Bineet started his talk on scrapers from very basics. Discussing how scrapers are involved in our everyday Internet life, i.e how Google and other search engines make use of scrapers commonly called crawlers. His talk quickly turned into a discussion, and soon we were all discussing how scrapers are built at [SpiderOrb Pvt. Ltd.](http://spiderorb.com/), challenges they face. Majority of the talk then went into the business ideas that can be (and are) built around scraping content from web. We discussed how many startups are thriving off of content scraped from around the Internet. Bineet also touched the legal side of scraping, but eventually he caved in to his evil intentions and gave away some very evil business ideas which can be built around web scrapers. It was awesome listening to him.

Time simply flew away while discussing technical and business ideas. Paramvir shared his experience of 10 years in programming and finance fields. We got to learn many things while discussing ideas with him. He also indulged Bineet in somewhat deep technical topics of how he build scrapers in Python, how scrapers can be/are built for technologies like asynchronously loaded Javascript, Android/iOS apps, and also gave examples of scrapers he has seen during his work.

We had very meaningful discussion with Vidur regarding how we can successfully bootstrap a healthy tech community in and around Chandigarh. He was of the opinion that at first we need good attendance in the meetups, so we shall keep our topics beginner friendly. I was of the opinion that we want a technical community, so we shall have topics that attract tech people. There was a clash of opinions, but Vidur presented some very good points.

As the conclusion of the meetup, we discussed what to do in next meet. Paramvir proposed a talk on Blockchain, and then came the discussion of a beginner friendly topic again. So we decided to have a poll, and let the community decide which topic will be up for next meetup's agenda.

Here are the four topics for the poll:

  1. Blockchain by Paramvir
  2. How to host a simple website for zero cost (and other fun things to do with git)
  3. Everything you need to know about modern day Javascript apps; and let's build one (hands on session)
  4. Anything else (please mention in comments on [the poll](https://www.meetup.com/Chandigarh-Programmers-Club/polls/1237823/))

And [here's the poll](https://www.meetup.com/Chandigarh-Programmers-Club/polls/1237823/), please do vote.

### A small request from this meetup's host

It was very generous of Workcave to provide space for hosting this meetup. Vidur was an awesome host. He made a small request, for us to spread word about his co-working space Workcave (which I recommend). Please do like their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/workcave/), and consider Workcave if you or someone you know is looking for a place to work from/bootstrap their startup.
