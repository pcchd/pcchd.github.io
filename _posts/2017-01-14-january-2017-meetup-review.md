I am writing this review a month late. Honestly, I forgot to write a review. As of now, this site/blog is
more of a consistent-record thing rather than a usable source, so I am putting this here for sake of
consistency.

Topic for this meetup was "Blockchain Technology", lead by Paramvir (who was the speaker). The meetup went
fairly well. We had a healthy discussion around not just Blockchain but also few different topics. All in all, it was a good meetup.

Paramvir shared some resources later on the slack channel, which gave something interesting to read in the evening.

Turnout on this meetup was unexpectedly high than previous meetups. I believe it was because of all the "marketting" me and Vidur did. This made me think that may be instead of slow organic growth, perhaps we should deploy
some marketting tactics. There is a lot of talent in Tricity which can contribute to a good tech community, but
can't because of lack of discover-ability.
